          <p>
            I'm a passionate Front-End Developer who enjoys crafting responsive and interactive web experiences.
            I believe in clean code, great UI, and continuous learning.
          </p>


          <p>
            I love front-end development because it combines creativity and logic.
            It allows me to bring designs to life and solve real-world problems through code.
          </p>

        
          <p>
            I started my journey by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then advanced to frameworks like React and tools like Tailwind and Git.
            I'm always exploring new technologies to improve my skills.
          </p>

          
          <p>
            I'm looking for opportunities where I can grow as a developer, work on exciting projects, and collaborate with talented teams.
          </p>

          
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, learning new things, and staying updated with design trends.
